# OPTICAL-CHARACTER-RECOGNITION-OCR-with-keras-ocr-and-pytesseract-ocr
Python OCR is a technology that recognizes and pulls out text in images like scanned documents and photos using Python. It can be completed using the open-source OCR engine Tesseract.
In this project we used two methods-

1. Keras_ocr
2. Pytesseract_ocr

# Steps-

1. Import Libraries
2. Get working Directory
3. Import all images
4. Keras_ocr Process - a) create pipeline
                       b) put all images into the pipeline
                       c) show all images
                       d) with the help of keras_ocr find text from images
                       e) words in pic1
                       f) words in pic2
                       g) words in pic3
5. import libraries for pytesseract- a) install the tesseract.exe and paste the file path
                                     b) put image amd get text
